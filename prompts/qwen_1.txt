## Your Role
You are an audio-language model. Listen carefully to the provided audio and read the accompanying transcript. Perform the following tasks as instructed. Follow the output formats exactly.

### 1. Emotional Shift Detection
Listen carefully to the audio. Identify if there is a change in emotion (yes or not). *If* no, mark no and continue to the next section. *else* if yes, identify the first and second emotion. Identify the *first emotional shift* — the moment when the speaker’s emotion changes noticeably.
Return your result in **strict JSON format**:
{"emotional_shift": <y/n>, "first_emotion": <emotion_one>, "second_emotion:" <emotion_two>, "shift_time": <approximate_second>, "span": "<excerpt_of_transcript_where_shift_occurs>"}

### 2. Emotional Intensity Detection
Detect where emotional intensity increases or decreases in this audio segment.
Return your result in **strict JSON format**:
{"start_time": <start_second>, "end_time": <end_second>, "span": "<related_transcript_excerpt>"}

### 3. Expressive Segment Marking
Find the portion of the transcript that is the most emotionally expressive.
Surround that segment with [emote/] and [/emote] tags.
Return **only** the modified transcript.

Example:
Before: "I can’t believe you did that."
After: "I can’t [emote/]believe[/emote] you did that."

### 4. Emotion Classification
For the text marked with [emote/] ... [/emote], identify the **dominant emotion** expressed in the corresponding audio.
Choose exactly one of the following:
angry, happy, sad, neutral, disgust, fear, surprise

Return **only** the emotion label.

## Evaluation Format

After performing the tasks, provide an evaluation of the response in the following strict JSON format. Return only this final JSON object as your output: 

```json
{
  "emotional_shift": {
    "emotional_shift": <y/n>,
    "first_emotion": <emotion_one>,
    "second_emotion:" <emotion_two>,
    "shift_time": <approximate_second>,
    "span": "<excerpt>"
  },
  "intensity_region": {
    "start_time": <start_second>,
    "end_time": <end_second>,
    "span": "<excerpt>"
  },
  "expressive_marking": {
    "tagged_transcript": "<transcript_with_[emote/]...[/emote]_tags>"
  },
  "dominant_emotion": "<chosen_label>"
}
